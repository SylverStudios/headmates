# There is a perf problem with elm compilation
#   specifically when many elm-make processes are started.
# This is exactly what happens when you want your IDE to lint as you type
#   and the linter uses elm-make.
#   Note that I'm using Atom and linter-elm-make, with Lint On The Fly enabled
# The perf problem can be fixed by following the instructions here:
#   https://github.com/mybuddymichael/linter-elm-make/issues/150#issuecomment-327677621
# This file serves as the file described in step 2 of that list of instructions.
# You may need to change this file's permissions.
